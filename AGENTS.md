# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents and developers working in this repository.

## What this is

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for legal workflows (precedent search,
statute analysis, citation validation, contract clause diffing, brief
scaffolding), plus optional opt‑in live integrations (CourtListener/RECAP and
PACER). See `README.md` for the full feature list and `WORKFLOW_EXAMPLES.md`
for end‑to‑end examples.

## Project layout

- `main.py` — FastMCP entry point; exposes a module‑level `mcp` object and a
  `create_server()` factory. Registers everything and runs the transport.
- `utils.py` — `LegalDataManager` (loads `data/*.json`), `CitationParser`, and
  the `audit()` logger. `get_data_manager()` is a process‑wide singleton.
- `tools/`, `resources/`, `prompts/` — each module has a `register_*`
  function; the package `__init__.py` wires them together
  (`register_all_tools`, etc.).
- `integrations/` — `config.py` (feature flags + credentials from env),
  `courtlistener.py`, `pacer.py`. Disabled by default.
- `data/` — JSON seed data. Adding/adjusting data usually requires no code
  changes.
- `tests/` — `unit/` and `integration/`; shared fixtures/helpers in
  `tests/conftest.py` (`call_tool_json`, `read_resource_json`).

## How to run / test / lint (standard commands)

Commands are documented in `README.md` (Quick start + Testing sections) and
`requirements.txt`. In short: `python main.py` to run; `pytest`, `python -m
black .`, `python -m flake8 .`, `python -m mypy .` for checks.

## Conventions

- Tools/resources return `json.dumps(..., indent=2)` strings and call
  `audit(...)` for provenance.
- Keep the core deterministic and offline; live network access only through
  the opt‑in `integrations/` adapters.
- Never echo secrets (tokens/passwords) back in tool/resource output — see the
  `status()` methods for the safe pattern.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- **Dependencies** are installed by the startup update script (`pip install -r
  requirements.txt`, user site‑packages). You normally do not need to install
  anything manually.
- **PATH gotcha:** console scripts (`pytest`, `black`, `flake8`, `mypy`,
  `uvicorn`, `mcp`) install to `~/.local/bin`, which is not on `PATH` by
  default. Invoke them as `python3 -m pytest`, `python3 -m black .`, etc., or
  prepend `~/.local/bin` to `PATH`.
- **Running the server for local testing:** default transport is SSE on
  `127.0.0.1:8000` (endpoints `/sse` and `/messages/`). Start it in a
  long‑lived tmux session, e.g. `python3 main.py --transport sse`. Bind to
  `0.0.0.0` (`HOST=0.0.0.0`) only if a process outside the VM/container needs
  to reach it.
- **MCP Inspector (browser test):** run
  `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true MCP_AUTO_OPEN_ENABLED=false npx -y
  @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`. The UI serves on `localhost:6274` and its
  proxy on `6277` (both bind IPv6 `::1`, so use `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1`).
  Connect with Transport = SSE, URL = `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse`.
- **Live integrations are OFF by default** and must stay that way in tests. Do
  not enable PACER against production — it is billable. The test suite mocks
  `httpx` (`httpx.MockTransport`) so no real network calls occur; keep new
  integration tests network‑free the same way.
- **After editing code, restart the running server** to pick up changes (there
  is no auto‑reload in this setup).
- **`.venv` note:** creating a venv needs the `python3.12-venv` system package,
  which may be absent. The supported path is user‑level `pip install`, not a
  venv.
